## System Requirement

1. Intel PC running Debian for building Linux kernel and initramfs.
2. Internet connection to download source code.
3. QEMU for testing.

## Building Debone

In case the script is not executable do the following:
```
chmod +x build-debone-core.sh
```

Execute the script to build Debone Core:
```
./build-debone-core.sh
```

## Test on QEMU
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 32M -kernel bzImage -initrd initramfs.img \
    -append "console=ttyS0" -nographic
```

## Test on QEMU with KVM
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 32M -cpu host,-svm -smp 4 \
    -kernel bzImage \
    -initrd initramfs.img \
    -append "console=ttyS0" -nographic
```
